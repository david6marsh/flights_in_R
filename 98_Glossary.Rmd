# Glossary

Aviation is chock-a-block with acronyms. A good place to look for these is in [AIRIAL](https://www.eurocontrol.int/airial). The language of aviation and aviation statistics is also quite precise, though in practice people might say 'flight' when they strictly mean 'flight segment'. There is an elderly [EUROCONTROL glossary of statistics](TBD) and a more recent [Eurostat one](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/ks-gq-19-004). This glossary chapter is deliberately chooses more hand-waving definitions, over the strictly water-tight.
