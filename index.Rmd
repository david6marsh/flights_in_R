# How to use this book {#howto}
-- UNDER CONSTRUCTION! ---

This is a training and reference manual for Eurocontrol staff, on how to use RStudio to analyse our traffic data. All the data used in the examples, however, are from publicly-accessible pages on our website, so the contents should be useful to anyone interested in analysing and modelling air traffic.

In the first chapters, we take some first steps in R, using aviation examples and with an emphasis on making graphs of the data. In later chapters, we move on to data analysis and more complex topics in mapping and text analysis.

## Before you start

This short section is the only bit specific to Eurocontrol staff.

You need to have RStudio and R installed on your machine. These are available from IT Support as standard installations, or if you want to work on your own machine, both are open source: [R download here](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio download here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

We assume that you are familiar with air traffic data, so won't spend time explaining the concepts.

This book is available as [html here](https://david6marsh.github.io/flights_in_R/) and can be downloaded complete with data from here (TBD).

If you're working through the book as training, then it will help to install (TBD - training bundle)

If you want a more speedy introduction, then Enrico has covered the [important steps here](https://github.com/euctrl-pru/portal/wiki/Intro-to-everything). Sebastien and others have compiled an (internal) [wiki on the intranet](https://ost.eurocontrol.int/sites/STATFO/WikiPages/R_documentation.aspx).

There are also plenty of useful 'cheat sheets', I'll introduce my favourites as we go through.

## Ways to Use the Material

The book aims to support you using it in a number of different ways:

* Training. Work through chapters in order, or pick out specific chapters if you need a refresher on a topic (an R topic, or an aviation topic). Read the explanations, grab the code and run it, and test your understanding by answering questions [in square brackets in the text] and doing exercises.
* Reference. Use the book search (top left of this page) to find some how-to material directly.
* Snippets. The book builds up snippets of usable code (TBD - how complete?) for you to cut-and-paste.

But it is never going to replace the huge amount of excellent information, especially in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). A key principle is that _"Google is your friend"_: even if I prefer [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) for many purposes, a Google search is often more productive for R. Whether it's for how to do something, or how to respond to an error, usually someone has already suffered, and some kind person has answered. Google it.

## Structure of the book

* Chapters \@ref(howto) and \@ref(start) should get you up and running in RStudio.
* Chapters \@ref(firstLook) to 5 start with how to look at data, using a data viewer and with some initial graphs. If you're mostly using existing code that creates simple charts, written by someone else, then these chapters should help you find your way around, and start to adapt the code for your own needs.
* Chapters \@ref(loopsfunctions) (and TBD) do more data loading and wrangling, covering the basics of loops and functions
* more...TBD
* Chapter \@ref(maps) introduces the map functions in R, including where to find airspace structure data, and how to plot both great circle routes and actual route flown.
* Chapter \@ref(splitparse) covers pulling data out of strings (parsing) using 'regular expressions', with NOTAMs as the application.

## What's gone wrong?

Learning from mistakes is essential, so each chapter has a "what's gone wrong?" section near the end, discussing some typical potholes that we all fall into from time to time. Look there, especially if you don't see the results from the code in the book that you were expecting.

We start the book with one classic pitfall: R is *case sensitive*, which can be quite a culture shock if you've been brought up on other systems. This matters for filenames as well as code. When in doubt, check whether you've got the right mix of upper- and lower-case letters!
