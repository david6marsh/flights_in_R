We assume that you are familiar with air traffic data, so won’t spend time explaining the concepts. This book is available as html here (TBD) and can be downloaded complete with data from here (TBD). If you’re working through the book as training, then it will help to install (TBD - training bundle) If you want a more speedy introduction, then Enrico Spinielli has covered the important steps here.. There are also several useful ‘cheat sheets’ see (TBD) 1.2 Ways to Use the Material The book aims to support you using it in a number of different ways: Training. Work through chapters in order, or pick out specific chapters if you need a refresher on a topic. Read the explanations, grab the code and run it, and test your understanding by answering questions and doing exercises. Reference. Use the search to find some how-to material directly. Snippets. The book builds up snippets of usable code (TBD - how complete?) for you to cut-and-paste. But it is never going to replace the huge amount of excellent information, especially in stackoverflow.

Look there especially if you don’t see the results from the code in the book that you were expecting.

When in doubt, check the case! "]]
